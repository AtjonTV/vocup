# Vocup Documentation

## Development

Florian Amstutz developed Vocup as student not knowing much about programming.
The software includes a rich set of features implemented in just a few classes, half in English, half in German.

Cleaning this code will not be finished soon.
All German names and comments have to be translated in English.
New code should make use of object orientated programming and identifier should be written in [CamelCase](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x2dbyw72%28v=vs.71%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396).
Control names should begin upper case.
